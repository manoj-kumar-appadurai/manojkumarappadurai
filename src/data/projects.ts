    description: `SIDBI (Small Industries Development Bank of India) is a government-backed financial institution that supports micro, small, and medium enterprises across India. The platform aims to offer funding and development support to industries while promoting financial inclusion.

I was actively involved in enhancing the UI of SIDBIâ€™s internal banking modules, contributing to the optimization of form flows, component alignment, and overall layout consistency. The system handled complex banking operations and required pixel-perfect UI execution.

In collaboration with QA and the backend teams, I also responded to client-side observations, updated UIs dynamically, and ensured all improvements were production-ready. All updates were deployed live using FileZilla over secured FTP protocols.`,

Zenro also demanded a pixel-perfect user experience, and I handled the visual delivery including graphic design using Photoshop and PowerPoint. Final production deployment was done manually using FileZilla.`,
